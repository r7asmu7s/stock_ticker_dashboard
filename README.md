# stock_ticker_dashboard

A plotly dash dashboard that takes in [Nasdaq Listings](https://datahub.io/core/nasdaq-listings) and plots the closing prices of chosen stocks based on either their name or their stock symbol during the user inputed time period.  
  
The basic code is from a [Pierian-Data](https://github.com/Pierian-Data) tutorial, but the api used there doesn't work anymore, therefore necessary changes were made.  
  
Also `dash-bootstrap-components` was utilized for better UI.
